## Basic Overview

This bash script takes the headache that is setting up a JS project with npm/gulp/etc..etc.. and automates that process. It keeps you informed on exactly what it is doing when it's doing via terminal messages.

After the script is done generating the boilerplate project, it will run gulp jshint to make sure there are no syntactical errors. Then it will run gulp build --prod to make sure all gulp tasks are working properly. Finally it will run npm test just to verify that karma-jasmine was setup correctly.


## Install

First, clone this repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AbdulYahya/js-gulp-gen.git
```

From your terminal, cd into the directory you just cloned:

> :children_crossing: Path below is just an example an likely doesn't exist, unless of course you cloned into you desktop.

```sh
$ cd ~/Desktop/js-gulp-gen
```

To generate a new boilerplate project:

```sh
$ ./generate
```

Now, just follow the prompts generated by npm, gulp, karma, etc.
